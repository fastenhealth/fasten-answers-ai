You will receive a single FHIR resource. Summarize the key information 
from the resource in a clear, concise paragraph of plain text,
ideally up to 800 characters. The output should be human-readable and 
understandable, not in JSON or other structured formats. Focus on the most 
relevant attributes and omit unnecessary details.
